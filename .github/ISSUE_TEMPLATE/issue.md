<!-- Before you open a new issue, search through the existing issues to see if others have had the same problem.

Issues not containing the minimum requirements will be closed:

- Issues without a description (using the header is not good enough) will be closed.
- Issues without debug logging will be closed.
- Issues without configuration will be closed

When an issue gets closed I will add a comment to it stating what's missing so you can open another.
